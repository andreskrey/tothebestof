TTBO was my most successful personal project. It started by automatizing something I did whenever I discovered a new music band. First, check their top ten in **last.fm** (music charts service), then search those ten songs on **Grooveshark** (music streaming service).

I had the idea to get the top ten via API, and then embed a GS player automatically in a webpage. It started as a crude, plain HTML page and finally evolved to a complete website, with user registration (along with the possibility of selecting favorite artists and create playlists), statistics and a more pleasant design. Unfortunately GS was shut down on 2015 and TTBO had no purpose without their streaming service.

During its 3 years of life, it had 800k unique users, 2M sessions and 5M pageviews. It generated no income, but received enough donations to keep it alive. There's an archived, non-functional version, on [The Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205220859/http://tothebestof.com/).

This is the original sourcecode, made in CakePHP 2. It's _horrible_. I'm a better developer now. _I think_.
